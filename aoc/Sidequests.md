Once a decorated commander, now a legend whispered in fear.
Before Sir Carrotbane led the red team battalion, it was Hopper who carried them to countless victories. One achievement in particular, still unrevealed, even earned him the rank of Colonel. But King Malhare quickly rewrote history, claiming Hopper's accomplishments as his own. Forced to endure the King's lies and belittlement, Hopper's growing anger showed as a small twitch, earning him the mocking nickname "Colonel Panic."

Seizing the chance to ruin him further, Malhare demoted Hopper to court jester, turning the once-respected leader into a royal joke. Humiliated and furious, Hopper was finally imprisoned on HopSec Island when the King feared how strong his rage had become.

Now, locked away and stripped of everything, Hopper waits patiently and bitterly for the moment he can strike back.

King Malhare messed with the wrong rabbit!
